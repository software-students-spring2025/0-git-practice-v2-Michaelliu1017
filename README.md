[Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07836)
## Reflection
I find this article interesting because it explains how Google uses a single code repository--monorepo--to manage code for engineers around the world. Compared to the common microservice architecture with multiple Git repositories, Google uses a huge monorepo that stores billions of lines of code and relies on a strong infrastructure for code management, permission control, and continuous integration, which challenges the traditional concept of code management. 

## Reflection - Jasmine Zhang
My name is **Jasmine Zhang**. I find this article interesting because, although I can't fully grasp all the complex mathematical concepts presented, the exploration of covariantly constant solutions in Yang-Mills equations highlights the profound relationship between geometry and physics. The use of Clifford algebra and the generalization of previous results provides a compelling insight into advanced mathematical physics... This article underscores the intricate challenges and innovative approaches in the field, which I find both fascinating and inspiring despite its complexity.

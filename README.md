[Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07836)
## Reflection
I find this article interesting because it explains how Google uses a single code repository--monorepo--to manage code for engineers around the world. Compared to the common microservice architecture with multiple Git repositories, Google uses a huge monorepo that stores billions of lines of code and relies on a strong infrastructure for code management, permission control, and continuous integration, which challenges the traditional concept of code management.
